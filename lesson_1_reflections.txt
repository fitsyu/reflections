How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    it could be used to spot differences quickly

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    never fear anymore to make big changes 
    no need to save manually old version of a file

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    pros:
	- no need to save unnecessary changes
	- works can be separated logically

    cons:
	- it could be danger if we forgot to commit changes made but already working on new feature that deserves new commit

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Git was designed to control source codes in mind. Source files generally related to each other to make up a working sofware.
    While Google Docs designed to save any kind of file that might not be related at all.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log can be used to list recent commits
    git diff can be used to show difference between commits

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    I don't have to worry about it as git had my every changes recorded

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    I'd like to apply it into a small project hoping that eventually I'll be get used to it
