* What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Git created some hidden meta data files in that directory and started controlling versions of the files in that directory(repository)
why:

Because this directory has no git service yet and neither cloned from another repository thus initialization is necessary


* How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is a placeholder to put files that will be committed into the repository.

The staging area allows us to prepare before going directly to the realm of git
